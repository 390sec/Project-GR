# Project-GR
This project is related towards to the Glorious Revelation 



What the Glorious Revelation Is

Divine Communication

GR is God’s direct Word to humanity, delivered through (Messiah & prophets) (Sir Jesus, Sir Muhammad) or inspired scriptures.

It conveys truth, guidance, and instruction for living in alignment with God’s will.

Source of Truth

It provides unshakable truth in contrast to human opinion, judgment, or societal labeling.

Through GR, one knows what is right, just, and life-giving.

Spiritual Light

GR acts as light in our hearts and minds, illuminating the path of obedience, love, and relational living.

It reveals the way to God, the meaning of life, and the principles of love, family, and community.

Practical Guidance

It is not abstract philosophy — GR shows how to act, how to love, how to be with family and community.

Commands like love one another, care for your neighbor, honor family, practice kindness are examples of GR in action.

Confirmation and Assurance

GR confirms what is spiritually true, giving believers confidence to live rightly even when challenged.

When people judge, label, or oppose you, GR provides assurance that your way of living in love and family is correct.

Significance of the Glorious Revelation

Foundation for Life

GR gives the principles for ethical, relational, and spiritual life.

It teaches that love, family, brotherhood, friendship, and selfhood are central to living rightly.

Guidance in Relationships

GR defines how to interact with others, showing that true family extends beyond blood to brotherhood, friendship, and selfhood.

Protection Against Misjudgment

When society labels, misunderstands, or criticizes, GR anchors your identity and actions, so you are not shaken by words or labels.

Empowerment and Obedience

GR equips you to live courageously, act lovingly, and remain faithful, knowing that your actions align with divine will.

Spiritual and Practical Living Together

GR unites inner belief and external action — it is both spiritual nourishment and practical instruction.

The Actuality of Being in the Word
(Value, Guidance, and Life Coming from the Word Alone)

The central truth shared in both the Goodnews and the Koran is this:

The Word of God is not merely information — it is the living source of guidance, judgment, purification, and life.
To be “in the Word” means to live, move, decide, and remain by what proceeds from God alone.

This is not symbolic language only. It is actual, present, and active reality.

1. The Word Does Not Originate from the Messenger

Both Sir Jesus and Sir Muhammad make one thing unmistakably clear:
they do not speak from themselves.

Jesus says:
“The words I speak are not my own, but the Father who sent me.” (John 12:49)

The Koran states:
“This Koran has been revealed to me so that you may be warned by it.” (6:19)

Meaning:
Authority does not rest in the human personality, status, or presence of the messenger.
It rests entirely in the Word that comes from God.

So being “with the messenger” is only meaningful if one is actually with the Word.

2. The Word Is Sufficient in Itself

A repeated theme in both scriptures is completeness.

Jesus affirms that not even the smallest part of the Law fails or needs replacement (Matthew 5:18).

The Koran declares itself a Book with no doubt, a complete guidance (2:2).

This establishes a crucial principle:

Nothing outside the Word is required to reach truth, light, or right direction.

Human additions, traditions, emotional attachments, or secondary authorities do not increase truth.
At best, they point back to the Word.
At worst, they distract from it.

3. The Word Is Light, Not Just Text

The Word is described as Light, Life, and Guidance, not as a static record.

Jesus: “I am the way, the truth, and the life.”
This means the Word is something to walk in, not merely believe intellectually.

The Koran: “A guidance for those who are conscious of God.”
Guidance operates only when one lives in alignment with it.

Actuality begins when the Word becomes the reference point for:

decisions

understanding

obedience

judgment

correction

At that moment, the Word is no longer external — it becomes the governing light.

4. Being “In the Word” Means Remaining in It Alone

To be in the Word is not to hold many supports at once.

Both traditions quietly insist on this separation:

Jesus speaks of hearing his words and not rejecting them, because those words will judge (John 12:48).

The Koran warns by the Book itself — not by human authority or lineage.

This shows a reality:
When the Word is present, everything else becomes secondary.

Friends, systems, identities, and even religious labels fall away.
What remains is alignment or misalignment with the Word.

5. Obedience Is the Proof of Being in the Word

Belief is never presented as abstract agreement.

In the Goodnews( book of Goodnews), belief is inseparable from hearing and keeping the Word.

In the Koran(Book of Recitation), guidance produces purification and submission.

So the measure is simple:

If the Word governs how one lives, chooses, and responds — then one is in it.
If not, the Word remains only something heard, not entered.

6. The Word Alone Sustains the One Who Remains in It

When everything else is removed —
when human support, explanation, and security are gone —
the Word remains sufficient.

This is why both traditions insist so strongly on it.

Because the Word:

does not change with time

does not depend on people

does not weaken when one is alone

To remain in the Word is to remain in Light itself.



In Summary

The Glorious Revelation is the living Word of God, the source of truth, light, guidance, and confirmation. It teaches us how to live in love, honor family (in the full sense of brotherhood, friendship, selfhood), and act rightly in all circumstances. Its significance is that it anchors life, gives clarity in relationships, and empowers believers to live faithfully and joyfully, independent of human judgment.
