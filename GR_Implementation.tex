\section*{Introduction}

\textit{Glorious Revelation} is a faithful compilation of revealed words,
preserved exactly as they appear in their original revelation sources.
This work does not create new scripture, modify existing revelation,
or offer interpretation of sacred texts.
There ,it is as Lines are as it is.
The content of this work consists solely of revelation conveyed through
Sir,Jesus the Messiah and through Sir, the Prophet Muhammad.
These revealed words are gathered with care and presented without hierarchy,
comparison, or alteration.
This book functions only as a supportive compilation, not as a source of revelation.

Lines are presented for reading, awareness, and reflection.
All words remain intact, unchanged, and fully traceable to their original revelation.
Nothing is added, removed, renamed, or rewritten.

\textit{Glorious Revelation} exists to bring together revealed words as they were given,
maintaining their integrity and form.
It proceeds gradually, offering verses over time,
with full respect for the completeness and authority of revelation itself.

\subsection*{Guidance}

\textit{“Glorious Revelation is formed through Good News and Recitation, preserving revealed words exactly as given, unified for understanding and reflection.”}

This way of life is defined by worship of God, regular prayer, humility, and reliance upon Him.
It is lived with simplicity, restraint, patience, and gratitude, without attachment to wealth or status.

Conduct is governed by charity, justice, mercy, self-discipline, moderation, truthfulness, integrity, compassion, responsibility toward family, respect for others, and peaceful behavior.

This way of life is not self-designed, culturally constructed, or socially adapted.
It is received through revelation and practiced in submission to the will of God.

This presentation does not interpret, expand, or modify that way of life.
It records it as revealed and lived, solely for awareness and reflection.

\subsection*{ Confirmation}

Glorious Revelation is a confirmed collection of revealed words taken entirely from complete chapters of their original revelation sources, comprising both the Good News and the Recitation.

During the time of the Prophet Muhammad and the Messiah Jesus, revealed guidance focused solely on obedience to God and righteous living. All instructions were preserved exactly as given, without addition, worldly embellishment, ritual display, music, or cultural practices. Only the commands, as revealed, were followed and maintained in their integrity.

Glorious Revelation is intended as a supportive and reflective collection, prepared for careful reading, awareness, and understanding.

In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\\
Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds.\\
The Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\\
Master of the Day of Judgment.\\
You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.\\
Guide us on the Straight Path,\\
the path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked Your anger, nor of those who go astray.

O Prophet! Fear God and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites.\\
Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord; God is fully aware of what you do.\\
Put your trust in God; God is sufficient as Trustee.\\
God has not made a man’s two hearts within him, nor has He made your wives whom you declare unlawful as your actual mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons; these are only words you utter, but God speaks the truth and guides to the way.\\
Call them by the names of their fathers; that is more equitable in the sight of God.\\
The Prophet has a stronger claim on the believers than they have on themselves, and his wives are their mothers.\\
God took a covenant from the prophets and from you, and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary.\\
That God may question the truthful about their truth; and He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.\\
O you who believe! Remember God’s favor upon you when forces came against you.\\
When they came upon you from above and below you, and your eyes became dazed and your hearts reached the throats.\\
There the believers were tested and shaken severely.\\
And remember when the hypocrites and those with sickness of the heart said, “God and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion.”\\
And a group of them said, “O people of Medina, you cannot withstand the enemy attack, so go back,” and another group requested the Prophet’s permission to leave, saying, “Our homes are exposed,” though they were not exposed; they only wanted to flee.\\
And if a party of you had retreated, they would have caused corruption on earth and broken their covenant.\\
But God gave them victory; and He helped you with a mighty help.\\
And [remember] when the disbelievers intended to extend their hands against you, but God restrained their hands from you.\\
And fear God; and know that God is severe in punishment.\\
And remember when you asked help of your Lord, and He answered you, “Indeed, I will reinforce you with a thousand angels following one another.”\\
And God did not make it but good tidings and so that your hearts would be at ease thereby.\\
And victory is not but from God; indeed God is Powerful, Wise.\\
That God may reward the truthful for their truthfulness and punish the hypocrites if He wills, or accept their repentance.\\
Indeed, God is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful.\\

\textit{
Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.\\
And supper being ended, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray Him.\\
Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God.\\
Rose from supper, laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself.\\
After that He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.\\
Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, “Lord, are You washing my feet?”\\
Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know after this.”\\
Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.”\\
Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”\\
Jesus said to him, “He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you.”\\
For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, “You are not all clean.”\\
So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you?”\\
You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\\
If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.\\
For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.\\
Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.\\
If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.\\
“I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen.\\
But this is to fulfill the Scripture that says, ‘He who shared my bread has turned against me.’\\
I tell you this now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am.”\\
Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.

“Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.\\
In my Father’s house there are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?\\
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am you may be also.\\
And where I go you know, and the way you know.”\\
Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going, and how can we know the way?”\\
Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me.\\
If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; and from now on you know him and have seen him.”\\
Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”\\
Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?\\
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.\\
Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or else believe me for the very works’ sake.\\
Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in me will do the works that I do also; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to my Father.\\
And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.\\
If you ask anything in my name, I will do it for you.”

``Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ``I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.''\\
So the Pharisees said to him, ``You are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true.''\\
Jesus answered, ``Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.''\\
``You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one. Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me.''\\
``In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true. I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.''\\
They said to him therefore, ``Where is your Father?'' Jesus answered, ``You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.''\\
These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.\\
So he said to them again, ``I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.''\\
So the Jews said, ``Will he kill himself, since he says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?''\\
He said to them, ``You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins.''\\
So they said to him, ``Who are you?'' Jesus said to them, ``Just what I have been telling you from the beginning. I have much to say about you and much to judge, but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.''\\
They did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father.\\
So Jesus said to them, ``When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me. And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.''\\
As he was saying these things, many believed in him.

``And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up.\\
And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day,\\
and he stood up to read.\\
And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him.\\
He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,\\
``The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,\\
because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.\\
He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives\\
and recovering of sight to the blind,\\
to set at liberty those who are oppressed,\\

And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.\\
And he began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\\
”And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. \\
And they said, “Is not this Joseph's son?”And he said to them, “Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself.\\
’ What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.”And he said, “Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.\\
But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land,and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.And there were many lepersain Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.”When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath.\\

Jesus said, “You have answered correctly; do this and you will live.”\\
But wanting to justify himself, the lawyer asked, “And who is my neighbor?”\\
Jesus replied with a story: A man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho was attacked by robbers. They beat him, took his possessions, and left him half-dead.\\
A priest passed by but ignored him. A Levite also passed and did nothing.\\
But a Samaritan, moved with compassion, approached, bandaged his wounds, took him to an inn, and cared for him.\\
Jesus concluded: “Go and do likewise.”\\
Love is active and crosses social boundaries; family is not only blood but also those we serve in need, embodying friendship, brotherhood, and self-care in action.

but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish,
for joy that a human being has been born into the world.\\
So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again,
and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.\\
In that day you will ask nothing of me.
Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.\\
Until now you have asked nothing in my name.
Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.

“If you love me, you will keep my commandments.And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper,fto be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.\\
“I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.\\
Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.\\
”Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?”Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.\\
Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.
“These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you.\\ But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.\\
Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place you may believe.\\
I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no claim on me,but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go from here.\\

``I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.\\
Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.\\
Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.\\
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.\\
I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.\\
If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.\\
If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.\\
By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.\\
As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love.\\
If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.\\
These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.\\
``This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.\\
Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.\\
You are my friends if you do what I command you.\\
No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.\\
You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.\\
These things I command you, so that you will love one another.''

``And Jesus cried out and said, ``Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.\\
And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.\\
I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.\\
If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.\\
The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.\\
For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak.\\
And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me.''}
